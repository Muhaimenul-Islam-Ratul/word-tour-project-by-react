### üåç Country Information App

This project is a **React-based web application** that displays information about **250 countries**, including their names, flags, regions, populations, and more. It utilizes modern React features such as **components**, **props**, `useState`, and `useEffect` for dynamic data handling and rendering. The project makes use of the **`map()`** function to efficiently render a list of country cards, each with its own details. It's a great example of building **interactive UIs** with **reusable components** and fetching data from **external APIs**.
